### Hi there 👋
My name is Jonathan Ling and I'm a software engineer at Actabl. My responsibilities there include:
- Front end UI development with Angular 10
- Back end API development with Java 8, Java 17, and Kotlin on AWS Lambda
- Scripting tasks I don't want to do more than once
- Posting links to cool new tech in Slack
- Jenkins build server administration

In my spare time I like to:
* Work on open source software projects like:
  - [Node-Virtualization/node-virtualbox](https://github.com/Node-Virtualization/node-virtualbox)
  - [colonelpopcorn/rippr](https://gitlab.com/colonelpopcorn/rippr)
  - [My personal home server scripts](https://gitlab.com/colonelpopcorn/home-server)
  - [My sandbox/learning repository](https://gitlab.com/colonelpopcorn/sandbox)
